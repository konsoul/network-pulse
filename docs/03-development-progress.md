## 🏗️ Data Layer Architecture Plan

### Network Diagnostic Tools Strategy

**📋 Comprehensive Tool Analysis Complete** (July 20, 2025)

✅ **Research Completed**: Available macOS network tools identified and documented  
✅ **Live Testing**: Router connectivity and device discovery tested  
✅ **Data Mapping**: Tool outputs mapped to TypeScript interfaces  
✅ **Implementation Strategy**: 3-phase approach defined  

**📖 Full Documentation**: See [Network Diagnostic Tools Guide](./04-network-diagnostic-tools.md)

**Key Findings Summary:**
- **6 Core Tools Available**: ping, traceroute, arp, netstat, networksetup, DNS tools
- **Router Status**: 192.168.0.1 responding at ~8.6ms (excellent)
- **Network Discovery**: 5+ devices automatically detected via ARP
- **Ready for Implementation**: All tools verified and mapped to our interfaces

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Backend services to execute network utilities
2. Frontend components to display diagnostic results
3. Real-time updates for continuous monitoring
4. Historical data storage for trend analysis

### Core Data Entities

#### 1. Network Device

```typescript
// Planned structure - to be refined
interface NetworkDevice {
  id: string
  name: string
  ip_address: string
  device_type: 'router' | 'switch' | 'server' | 'workstation' | 'other'
  status: 'online' | 'offline' | 'warning' | 'critical'
  last_seen: Date
  location?: string
  metrics: DeviceMetrics
}
```

#### 2. Network Metrics

```typescript
// Planned structure - to be refined
interface DeviceMetrics {
  ping_response_time: number // milliseconds
  packet_loss_percentage: number
  bandwidth_utilization: number // percentage
  cpu_usage?: number // percentage
  memory_usage?: number // percentage
  uptime: number // seconds
  timestamp: Date
}
```

#### 3. Alert/Notification

```typescript
// Planned structure - to be refined
interface NetworkAlert {
  id: string
  device_id: string
  alert_type: 'connectivity' | 'performance' | 'threshold' | 'security'
  severity: 'info' | 'warning' | 'critical'
  message: string
  timestamp: Date
  acknowledged: boolean
  resolved: boolean
}
```

### Data Storage Strategy (Phase 1)

- **Development**: Real-time network data from personal router (192.168.0.1)
- **Initial API**: Next.js API routes executing network commands directly
- **Future**: PostgreSQL integration for historical data storage (Phase 4)

### API Endpoints Planning

```
GET    /api/devices           - List all network devices
GET    /api/devices/[id]      - Get specific device details
POST   /api/devices           - Add new device
PUT    /api/devices/[id]      - Update device info
DELETE /api/devices/[id]      - Remove device

GET    /api/metrics/[id]      - Get device metrics history
POST   /api/metrics           - Submit new metrics data

GET    /api/alerts            - List active alerts
POST   /api/alerts/[id]/ack   - Acknowledge alert
PUT    /api/alerts/[id]       - Update alert status

GET    /api/dashboard/summary - Dashboard overview data
```

- [x] ✅ **Successful Live Testing**: Confirmed ping function works with multiple targets:
  - Router (192.168.0.136): 0.13ms response time - Excellent!
  - Google DNS (8.8.8.8): 37.00ms response time - Excellent internet connectivity!

  ```
  [
    'PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8): 56 data bytes',
    '64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=0 ttl=114 time=24.039 ms',
    '--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---',
    '3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss',
    'round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 23.182/29.267/40.580/8.007 ms'
