## üèóÔ∏è Data Layer Architecture Plan

### Network Diagnostic Tools Strategy

**Recently Discussed Tools for Integration:**
- **ping** - Response times, packet loss, basic connectivity testing
- **traceroute** - Network path analysis, hop identification, bottleneck detection  
- **uptime monitoring** - Service availability, downtime tracking, reliability metrics

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Backend services to execute network utilities
2. Frontend components to display diagnostic results
3. Real-time updates for continuous monitoring
4. Historical data storage for trend analysis

### Core Data Entities

#### 1. Network Device

```typescript
// Planned structure - to be refined
interface NetworkDevice {
  id: string
  name: string
  ip_address: string
  device_type: 'router' | 'switch' | 'server' | 'workstation' | 'other'
  status: 'online' | 'offline' | 'warning' | 'critical'
  last_seen: Date
  location?: string
  metrics: DeviceMetrics
}
```

#### 2. Network Metrics

```typescript
// Planned structure - to be refined
interface DeviceMetrics {
  ping_response_time: number // milliseconds
  packet_loss_percentage: number
  bandwidth_utilization: number // percentage
  cpu_usage?: number // percentage
  memory_usage?: number // percentage
  uptime: number // seconds
  timestamp: Date
}
```

#### 3. Alert/Notification

```typescript
// Planned structure - to be refined
interface NetworkAlert {
  id: string
  device_id: string
  alert_type: 'connectivity' | 'performance' | 'threshold' | 'security'
  severity: 'info' | 'warning' | 'critical'
  message: string
  timestamp: Date
  acknowledged: boolean
  resolved: boolean
}
```

### Data Storage Strategy (Phase 1)

- **Development**: JSON files for mock data
- **Initial API**: Next.js API routes with file-based storage
- **Future**: PostgreSQL integration (Phase 4)

### API Endpoints Planning

```
GET    /api/devices           - List all network devices
GET    /api/devices/[id]      - Get specific device details
POST   /api/devices           - Add new device
PUT    /api/devices/[id]      - Update device info
DELETE /api/devices/[id]      - Remove device

GET    /api/metrics/[id]      - Get device metrics history
POST   /api/metrics           - Submit new metrics data

GET    /api/alerts            - List active alerts
POST   /api/alerts/[id]/ack   - Acknowledge alert
PUT    /api/alerts/[id]       - Update alert status

GET    /api/dashboard/summary - Dashboard overview data
```
